                                <p>The first design studio session of the term commenced by introducing us to various perspectives in the realm of research. While the most conventional and widely recognized approach involves researching from a second or third-person standpoint, a significant distinction lies in the extent to which the researcher becomes personally immersed in the process, rather than maintaining a detached standpoint.</p>
                                <p>This particular perspective centers on an individual&#x27;s thoughts, emotions, perceptions, and sensations within a specific context or situation, as opposed to emphasizing interaction and communication between the researcher and the subject (second person), or focusing on external observations of behavior, often striving for objectivity and generalizability (third person). The methods employed for data collection also vary significantly across these perspectives.</p>
                                <p>In first-person research, qualitative techniques such as interviews, diaries, open-ended surveys, and participant observations are commonly employed. On the other hand, second-person research often necessitates direct interaction with subjects through interviews, observations, or feedback. Third-person research, in contrast, typically relies on quantitative methods such as experiments, surveys, and observations.</p>
                                <p>Through this exploration, I have come to realize that as designers and researchers, we should prioritize first-person research as our primary methodology to achieve immersion and depth in our work. It is imperative that we do not distance ourselves from the world we are designing for, and by embracing subjectivity, we can become more intimately connected and efficient in our endeavors.</p>
                                <p>This concept reminds me of a scene from the 2011 movie &quot;Contagion.&quot; Towards the end of the film, a scientist discovers the very first vaccine. In the field of medicine, first-person research is indeed rare and unconventional. Medical researchers typically conduct clinical trials, engage in objective observation, collect feedback, and report adverse events, following a more detached and standardized approach.</p>
                                <p>However, in the movie, the character takes an extraordinary leap by bypassing the entire process and injecting herself with the vaccine she discovered. This raises the intriguing question: Is this an extreme manifestation of first-person research?</p>

                                <p>‍</p>
                                <p>Afterward, we engaged in a thoughtful discussion about the various roles that a prototype can assume. When designing and testing our work, it becomes apparent that a prototype can serve multiple functions. It can be utilized experimentally to validate a specific hypothesis or serve as an open-ended exploration tool to gather data that informs the design of subsequent iterations. Furthermore, a prototype can take on the role of a research archetype, serving as a tangible embodiment of a research concept, enhancing our understanding, and defining the research space. Lastly, it can function as a vehicle for inquiry, where the research contribution is intricately tied to the process of crafting artifacts.</p>
                                <p>‍</p>
                                <p>A prototype can indeed serve one or even two roles simultaneously. However, what&#x27;s crucial for a designer is to have a well-defined plan and to prepare in advance to determine what they intend to learn as they unveil their work to the world. Having a clear and structured approach is fundamental to effectively communicate the purpose and objectives behind the prototype, ensuring that the desired insights and outcomes are achieved. This proactive stance not only enhances the design process but also maximizes the value derived from presenting the prototype to the broader audience.</p>
                                <p>‍</p>
                                <p>The subsequent exercise unfolded as follows: Initially, we engaged in discussions with a fellow colleague, delving into a detailed exploration of a past project they had undertaken. This dialogue allowed us to gain a comprehensive understanding of the project&#x27;s original purpose and functionality. Subsequently, our task was to reimagine and redesign the project, assigning it a new and distinct role. This creative process challenged us to envision a transformed utility for the project, pushing the boundaries of its initial concept.</p>
                                <p>Following this, we took the project redesign to another level by utilizing very basic materials such as balloons, sticks, and pins. With these primitive materials, we embarked on the task of repurposing the project, giving it an entirely different function. This part of the exercise encouraged us to think outside the box, demonstrating how innovative solutions could emerge from limited resources and unconventional materials.</p>
                                <p>In summary, the exercise encompassed understanding, redesigning, and repurposing a colleague&#x27;s past project, fostering creativity, adaptability, and resourcefulness in the design process.</p>
                                <p>‍</p>

                                <p>‍</p>
                                <p>I collaborated on my colleague <a href="https://www.oliverlloyddesign.co.uk/">Oliver Lloyd&#x27;s</a> project named &quot;<a href="https://www.oliverlloyddesign.co.uk/home/cara">Cara</a>.&quot; Here&#x27;s a description of the project:</p>
                                <p>‍</p>

                                <p>During my discussion with Oliver, it became evident that the primary role of the &quot;Cara&quot; prototype was to rigorously test a specific hypothesis. In this context, the prototype was designed to serve as a crucial tool for conducting experiments, making it a clear fit for role #1. The meticulous design of the experiment was central to the prototype&#x27;s purpose, underlining the significance of its role in hypothesis testing and validation.</p>
                                <p>I took the initiative to embark on the task of reimagining Oliver&#x27;s work and transforming it into a role #2 prototype, which involves an open-ended exploration of the project. Admittedly, the challenge of achieving this with balloons, pins, and plastic straws presented quite a creative puzzle. While I couldn&#x27;t entirely replicate the original project&#x27;s complexity and functionality with these basic materials, I arrived at a unique compromise. Allow me to explain:</p>
                                <p>Instead of replicating the exact features and intricacies of &quot;Cara&quot; with balloons, pins, and plastic straws, I focused on distilling its core concept into a more simplified, tactile experience. I crafted a hands-on model that encouraged users to engage in a playful and open-ended exploration of the fundamental principles behind &quot;Cara.&quot; By manipulating the balloons, pins, and straws, individuals could experiment with various configurations and gain a basic understanding of the underlying concepts.</p>
                                <p>While this version may not have matched the full functionality of the original prototype, it served as a valuable tool for sparking curiosity and fostering a deeper appreciation of the project&#x27;s principles. It offered a more accessible entry point for individuals to interact with and learn from the project, embodying the essence of role #2 in a simplified yet engaging manner.</p>
                                <p>‍</p>
                                <h3>What if? </h3>
                                <p>Rather than focusing on testing the practicality and usage of &quot;CARA&quot; in a garden setting, the alternative role I envisioned for &quot;CARA&quot; involved using it as an instrument for the collection, recording, and measurement of various phenomena. To accomplish this, I proposed pairing it with a comprehensive approach that included interviews and ethnographic analysis.</p>
                                <p>Oliver had introduced a remarkable feature to &quot;CARA,&quot; enabling it to provide an augmented reality (AR) preview of how it could visually integrate into a garden space. However, I explored a novel concept to replace the AR component: the creation of a container made from elastic material that could be filled with rainwater. This container would expand or contract depending on the amount of rainfall it collected.</p>
                                <p>In this scenario, &quot;CARA&quot; would act as an innovative tool for monitoring and quantifying rainfall patterns in the garden. The elastic container&#x27;s size changes would serve as a real-time indicator of precipitation levels, offering a tangible and practical means of measuring rainfall. This adaptation would provide valuable data for environmental analysis, gardening purposes, and water conservation efforts, demonstrating how &quot;CARA&quot; could transition from a visual AR aid to a functional instrument for data collection and resource management.</p>
                                <p>‍</p>
                                <p>The process I would follow to repurpose &quot;CARA&quot; would involve the following steps:</p>
                                <ol start="" role="list">
                                  <li>Install an &#x27;inflatable and elastic material&#x27; in the user&#x27;s garden, inspired by the use of balloons as a primary design element. This material will reach maximum capacity, at which point excess water will be released into an irrigation system, ideal for areas with heavy rainfall.</li>
                                  <li>To monitor the amount of rainfall over a period of time, track the volume collected in cubic meters (m³) and note the space occupied by the mass in the user&#x27;s garden.</li>
                                  <li>Conduct an interview with the user to assess their convenience and comfort level regarding this system. Inquire about the amount of space they are willing to allocate, identify potential dealbreakers in terms of maintenance, and ask about any solutions they may have employed in the past to address similar issues.</li>
                                  <li>At the conclusion of the test, we will gain insights into the dimensions of &quot;CARA&quot; and develop a deeper understanding of the user&#x27;s expectations and preferences.</li>
                                </ol>

                                <p>The weak signals seminar has been one of the most intriguing and enriching experiences of my life. </p>
                                <p>Weak signals serve as the precursors to significant changes that are poised to reshape our world. They not only signify impending shifts but also provide us, as designers, with valuable tools, methods, and opportunities to prepare ourselves for these changes and avoid being caught off guard.</p>
                                <p>‍</p>
                                <p>The seminar commenced with an engaging exercise in which we randomly mapped out weak signals and then proceeded to share our thoughts and experiences related to these signals. This exercise encouraged collaborative exploration and provided a diverse perspective on the evolving landscape of emerging trends and potential disruptions.</p>
                                <figure style="max-width:1238pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image">

                                <p>Following the initial exercise, we delved deeper into the subject matter through a group activity. Rather than conducting it as a whole class, we divided into smaller groups. Once more, our task was to identify connections among seemingly unrelated topics pertaining to the future. This smaller group dynamic allowed for more focused discussions and facilitated the exploration of intricate interconnections between various weak signals and potential future developments.</p>
                                <p>‍</p>

                                <p>One of the most captivating outcomes of this exercise was the opportunity to learn more about biomimicry from our colleague, Albert. It became evident that biomimicry is a fascinating and potentially powerful tool in the realm of future design. This newfound knowledge shed light on the innovative possibilities that can arise when we draw inspiration from nature to inform and shape our designs.</p>
                                <p>‍</p>
                                <h2>My design space</h2>
                                <p>‍</p>
                                <p>IIt was time for us to make the concept of emergent futures our own. As an incurable generalist and someone who is inherently curious about everything, I&#x27;ve always been drawn to the idea of <strong>democratization </strong>in all aspects of life. </p>
                                <p>Specifically, I&#x27;m deeply interested in how we can empower individuals and communities to grow their own food, build their own homes, generate their own power, and actively engage with systemic and global challenges rather than relying on external entities to solve them.</p>
                                <p>When it comes to addressing issues like climate change, I&#x27;ve grown weary of the often-heard refrain that &quot;70% of pollution is caused by big companies, and I cannot make a change.&quot; It&#x27;s a sentiment that dismisses individual agency and responsibility. </p>
                                <p>I often think about how this parallels with the sentiment of many UK citizens who once believed they would never have the opportunity to exit the EU and that their voices and votes would not matter. The lesson here is that individual actions and collective efforts can indeed bring about significant change, even in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges.</p>
                                <p>I have selected the following weak signals as the focal points within my design space:</p>
                                <figure style="max-width:3840pxpx" class="w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image">

                                <p>Subsequently, we explored a multiscalar personal design space, examining how these selected weak signals scale and impact not only me but also everyone in my immediate surroundings and beyond. This holistic perspective allowed us to consider the broader implications and interconnectedness of these signals, recognizing their potential to influence various levels of society and the environment.</p>

                                <p>The Drones for Whale Research programme, from the Ocean Alliance, is on a mission to democratise whale science through cheap and non-invasive technology. Standing on a boat Dr. Iain Kerr, CEO of Ocean Alliance, watched the whale dive under the surface just as they pulled up next to it. This could mean an hour wait before they could take much-needed samples. But then he noticed the smell coming from the whale’s blow – if it smells this bad, he thought, there must be some organic matter. This encounter, combined with Iain’s interdisciplinary skill set and interest in drones, was the beginning of Ocean Alliance’s Drones for Whale Research programme. From collecting the ‘snot’ of whales to understand their health and ecology in a non-invasive way, the programme has since adapted the technology to many other research uses and are making the comparatively cheap technology available to scientists across the world. Through this comparable data, scientists will better know how to protect these amazing animals for the future.</p>
